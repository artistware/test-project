// Import core root reducer
// apply bootstrap with router - pass core router
// or maybe it could work the other way?
// passing a config would be interesting

// auto-routes.json
// this file should export from admin nav
// admin nav should warn if file and data are out of sync
// if they are not in sync, do not write to this file
// warn on dash
